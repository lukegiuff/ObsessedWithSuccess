# Hero Image Instructions

## Adding Your Hero Image

To add your hero image to the website:

1. **Place your image file** in this directory (`public/assets/images/`)
2. **Name it** `hero-placeholder.jpg` (or update the filename in `content/pages/home.md`)
3. **Recommended specifications:**
   - **Dimensions**: 1920x1080 pixels (or similar wide aspect ratio)
   - **Format**: JPG or PNG
   - **File size**: Under 500KB for optimal loading
   - **Style**: Professional, luxury aesthetic that represents elite executive recruiting

## Current Reference

The hero image is referenced in `content/pages/home.md` as:
```
featured_image: "/assets/images/hero-placeholder.jpg"
```

## Styling Notes

The hero image will be:
- Used as a background with a dark overlay for text readability
- Displayed full-screen on desktop
- Cropped responsively on mobile devices
- Combined with the luxury branding and value proposition text

Choose an image that conveys professionalism, success, and luxury - perhaps a modern office setting, business handshake, or professional team environment.
