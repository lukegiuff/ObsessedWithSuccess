# Getting Started with Next.js: A Modern React Framework

Next.js has revolutionized the way we build React applications, offering a powerful combination of performance, developer experience, and deployment simplicity. In this post, we'll explore why Next.js has become the go-to choice for modern web development.

## Why Choose Next.js?

### 1. **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**
Next.js provides built-in server-side rendering, which means your pages are rendered on the server before being sent to the client. This results in:
- Faster initial page loads
- Better SEO performance
- Improved user experience

### 2. **Static Site Generation (SSG)**
For content that doesn't change frequently, Next.js can pre-generate pages at build time, creating incredibly fast static sites.

### 3. **API Routes**
Build your backend API right alongside your frontend code. No need for a separate server setup!

## Key Features That Make Next.js Special

- **Automatic Code Splitting**: Only load the JavaScript needed for each page
- **Built-in CSS Support**: Support for CSS Modules, Sass, and CSS-in-JS
- **Image Optimization**: Automatic image optimization with the `next/image` component
- **File-based Routing**: Create routes simply by adding files to the `pages` directory

## Getting Started

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest my-app
cd my-app
npm run dev
```

That's it! You now have a fully functional Next.js application running locally.

## What's Next?
